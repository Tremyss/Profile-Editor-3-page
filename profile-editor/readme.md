Profile editor

You've been assigned to create a simple profile editor by your boss. You got the backend done already, and he wants a nice design from Behance.

What are you going to learn?
working with and existing backend
using Fetch API to handle forms

Tasks
Select a nice UI from frontend and create a good looking, user friendly profile page editor.

1. A UI design project selected from Behance and your Mentor agreed that you can make it.
2. Opening the profile page shows the following (input) fields: first name, surname, address inputs (zip, country, city, street, house number) profile image (with preview), introduction.

3. Opening the profile page shows a SAVE button as well.  
   Clicking on this button is saving the fields data into a profile.json file
   <!-- todo -->
   (and the profile image into a profile.jpg file) without reloading the page.
4. Opening the profile page shows a DELETE button as well. Clicking on this button is deleting all the data (and emptying all the input fields) without reloading the page.

Hints:
you need to start the server if you want to get data from it
you only need to work with 1 profile, when you save it should overwrite the existing data and image
