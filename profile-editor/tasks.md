Profile editor

You've been assigned to create a simple profile editor by your boss. You got the backend done already, and he wants a nice design from Behance.

What are you going to learn?
working with and existing backend
using Fetch API to handle forms

Tasks
Select a nice UI from frontend and create a good looking, user friendly profile page editor.
1 A UI design project selected from Behance and your Mentor agreed that you can make it.
2 Opening the profile page shows the following (input) fields: first name, surname, address inputs (zip, country, city, street, house number) profile image (with preview), introduction.
3 Opening the profile page shows a SAVE button as well. Clicking on this button is saving the fields data into a profile.json file (and the profile image into a profile.jpg file) without reloading the page.
4 Opening the profile page shows a DELETE button as well. Clicking on this button is deleting all the data (and emptying all the input fields) without reloading the page.

Hints
you need to start the server if you want to get data from it
you only need to work with 1 profile, when you save it should overwrite the existing data and image
